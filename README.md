# PROBLEM & SOLUTION: poor people run into Medical Debts so we want to connect them to donors to help them raise funds for their debts.

## PRESENTATION: i know a poor person called Kiki, i want to show you how kiki can raise funds for her medical bill using our web app. 

## DONOR DESCRIPTION: (just select anyone in the audience). Please can anyone offer to donate to kiki (Details: Name, Email, Phone, Amount)
##

## DEBTOR DESCRIPTION: some of you will be wondering how kiki will withdraw the money and pay her medical bills. 
1. let's assume kiki already has an account.
2. on kiki's page she can see all her campaigns and can initaite a withdrawal by clicking on the withdrawal button. (kiki is now able to pay her medical bills).
3. medical debtors can also call this number (NUMBER) to help create an account if they cant do it themselves.
